    "Solution": "**Problem Analysis**\n\nThe provided text appears to be a hotel receipt or invoice from Hampton Inn by Hilton in Montreal, Canada. It contains information about the guest's stay, including room details, dates, rates, taxes, and payment information.\n\n**Approach**\n\nTo solve this problem, we will break down the input text into its constituent parts and extract relevant information using regular expressions and string manipulation techniques. We will then create a Python class to represent each part of the receipt, such as the guest's stay, room details, and payment information.\n\n**Complete Code**\n```python\nimport re\n\nclass HotelReceipt:\n    def __init__(self, text):\n        self.text = text\n        self.guest_info = None\n        self.room_info = None\n        self.payment_info = None\n\n    def parse(self):\n        # Regular expression patterns for extracting information\n        guest_pattern = r\"nom st adresse:\\s*(\\w+),?\\s*(\\w+)?\"\n        room_pattern = r\"chambre/room:\\s*(\\d+)/(\\w+)\"\n        payment_pattern = r\"montant total:\\s*(\\$\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)?)\"\n\n        # Extract guest information\n        match = re.search(guest_pattern, self.text)\n        if match:\n            self.guest_info = {\"name\": match.group(1), \"address\": match.group(2)}\n\n        # Extract room information\n        match = re.search(room_pattern, self.text)\n        if match:\n            self.room_info = {\"room_number\": int(match.group(1)), \"room_type\": match.group(2)}\n\n        # Extract payment information\n        match = re.search(payment_pattern, self.text)\n        if match:\n            self.payment_info = {\"total_amount\": float(match.group(1))}\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"Guest: {self.guest_info['name']}, {self.guest_info['address']} \\nRoom: {self.room_info['room_number']} - {self.room_info['room_type']} \\nPayment: ${self.payment_info['total_amount']}\"\n\n# Usage example\nreceipt_text = \"\"\"\n... (rest of the receipt text)\n\"\"\"\n\nreceipt = HotelReceipt(receipt_text)\nreceipt.parse()\nprint(receipt)\n\n```\n**Usage Example**\n\nTo use this code, simply create an instance of the `HotelReceipt` class and pass the receipt text as a string. Then, call the `parse()` method to extract the relevant information from the text. Finally, print the receipt object using the `__str__()` method.\n\n**Error Handling**\n\nThe code includes basic error handling by checking if the regular expression patterns match successfully before extracting information. However, you may want to add more robust error handling depending on your specific requirements.\n\n**Optimization Notes**\n\nThis code is designed for simplicity and readability rather than performance optimization. If you need to process large volumes of receipt data, you may want to consider using a more efficient parsing algorithm or optimizing the regular expression patterns.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input text is well-formatted and free of errors. In a real-world scenario, you would likely want to add more robust error handling and validation to ensure that the code can handle invalid or malformed input."
